<!--
  below, we are doing property binding. disabled is a property of the html element button.
  Wrapping it in [square brackets] marks it as a prop for binding, and then following with
  ="XXX" where XXX is a property of the underlying component hooks it up to the component.
-->
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>
<!--
  below the two <p>'s render the same. First one uses string interpolation to get the value
  of allowNewServer. Second one uses property binding, having bound to <p>'s html property
  'innerText' and linking it to allowNewServer.
-->
<p>{{ allowNewServer }}</p>

<p [innerText]="allowNewServer">will this show up? turns out no it will not.</p>
